I am, in fact, an actual mom, and I live in Indianapolis with my giant Icelandic husband and our spawn (singular). I'm a self-lead learner currently attempting to tackle how to program, and I fancy working as a full stack web developer once my kid is in kindergarten. I'm an art school dropout with a background in social work, and currently I'm currently working as a remote intern at a local community college, as a teacher's assistant in a virtual classroom environment.

_If you can't tell already, I like to have my fingers in a lot of different pies:_

1. I have a deep interest in computers and technology in general
2. [I'm an artist](https://www.instagram.com/ykantjennypaint.jpg/), and originally started out as an art school student.
3. If I'm not painting, I'm weaving
4. I study the Tarot: its imagery, its history, and the psychology of it.
5. I'm a voracious reader.
6. I don't know how true any of it, but I'm deeply interested in the various personality sciences (pseudosciences?). Mostly I think of it as a fun way to think about myself. I'm a Capricorn Sun / Taurus Moon / Aries Rising. In MBTI, I test as an [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) and I'm an Enneagram [Type 5](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-5).
