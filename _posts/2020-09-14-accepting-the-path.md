Confession: At the age of 34, I still feel that I have not carved out a life of my own. I’ve lived at the whims of others for almost my entire life. I have been starving myself with this indecisiveness.

In an attempt to finally go against the stream of complacency, I submitted my application to Indiana University — for their online Informatics program — the other night. It’s my husband’s alma mater. It's taken me a long to get to this point. To commit, I mean. I've been waffling for the past two years about what I was going to do once I was done with community college, and that day is fast approaching. I'll be done in December, right before Ada turns 5. I turn 35 in January. I don't want to be in school for another 5 years of my life, but I want SOMETHING concrete behind me. 

I’ve been waffling around in community college since I moved in with my now-husband back in 2012. I had started with a two year degree in software development at a local community college in Hennepin, Minnesota. After my first semester, a teacher who taught several required courses for the program left. No one else taught the classes, and I could not advance in my degree. I switched to web design, because I had no idea what else to do (I wish someone had just told me that I didn’t have to sign up for classes next semester, that I could just wait it out. Advisement at that school was…lacking). 

I was content. But then my husband got a new job…in another state. Fine. Whatever. I’ll transfer my credits. Except the only credits that transferred were my general ed classes. A whole years of programming and web dev gone. I was unbelievable frustrated, and almost out of spite I decided to go with baking and pastry. Who doesn’t love baking, right? And guys, I was _good_ at it. I lived for the precision and logic of baking. I was so good my instructor had made copies of my lab notes to share with students.

The thing is, that entire first year (2015, if you’re counting) at the new school, I was pregnant. I was waddling around the lab in a maternity chef’s jacket, and towards the end I had to swallow my pride and ask for help with carting around the giant mixers or taking out trash when it was my turn (there was a lovely gentleman in my class with six kids of his own who always volunteered to help before I even asked). I was on my feet 5-6 hours a day, 2-3 days a week, and honestly, I loved it. After I delivered my daughter, I took a semester off to adjust to being a mom (a whole story in itself, one for another time). I went back in the fall of 2016, with my mother-in-law babysitting two days a week while I attended classes again.

…that arrangement lasted for all of eight weeks. It was too much of a commitment for my mother-in-law, I suppose. That also is a story in and of itself. The point is, I was back at square one. I had no one to watch my daughter, and the baking & pastry was a lab-heavy program. 

So I changed my major. Again. I went with the first online program I could find, which was a human services degree. To this day, I cannot tell you what I was thinking when I picked this program. I am not a people person. I am capable of being kind and patient, and I can carry a conversation, but it takes SO much out of me. I prefer to be in my head, and that has only intensified since I married and started a family. But I stuck it out with this degree, because changing my major four times already made a sizable dent in my self-confidence. I’m finishing up in December of this year, 2020.

I think often of the fig tree vision in Sylvia Plath’s _The Bell Jar_. It’s an image that haunts me.

> “I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”

I have chosen my fig and bit into it greedily. A part of me worries that I will come to regret it, but another part of me knows that I could carry that fear regardless of the path chosen. 

I’ll be 37-38 by the time I’m done at IU, should I get accepted. Who the fuck is going to hire a fat ginger who is teetering on the edge of 40, especially one who has never had any kind of seniority in any capacity? Am I sending my family further into debt for no reason? Am I even going to be able to do this? Not the school part—I’m a great student. I’m terrified of what comes after… of being handed responsibility. I’ve convinced myself that if I do get a job, I’ll find a way to accidentally burn it all to the ground. That I will be found out. A fraud. A hack. A witch to be trussed up and burned, for surely I found my way through the doors via devilry and the blackest of magic.
